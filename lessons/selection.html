				<h1>Copying, pasting and selection</h1>
				<p>So now you can fix your mistakes, dictate words and place letters. But more often than not, youÂ´re not really retyping everything if it needs to be placed somewhere else.
				All you do is select it, and place it somewhere else to save yourself the hassle. This lesson will show you a mangled chorus of a song text that you need to rearrange into the proper order.
				The link to this song can be found in the help page of this lesson.

					Step one of copying and pasting is the selection. Talon offers a whole range of different ways of selecting characters, lines and words.
					Like moving your arrow keys around using the phrases starting with go, and deleting things using the word clear, we can start a selection using the word select. <br/>
					<span class="text-emphasis">select all</span> for example will select everything in a text box. There's a ton of variations to this, like <span class="text-emphasis">select line</span> to select your current line,
					and <span class="text-emphasis">select word</span> to select your current word. <br/> If you remember the previous lesson, where we looked at clearing, we can also add a direction, like <span class="text-emphasis">select word left</span> to select the word to the left of the cursor.
					Or even <span class="text-emphasis">select up</span> to move your cursor up while selecting things. <br/>
					If you need more precise controls, like selecting a special character, you can use <span class="text-emphasis">select right</span> and <span class="text-emphasis">select left</span> to select single characters. You keep saying select phrases until you are satisfied with your current selection.
					You can find all these commands here: <a href="https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/edit/edit.talon#L40">core/edit/edit.talon</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Step two and three, the copying or cutting, and pasting of your selection, is are pretty self explanatory. The only commands you need to remember are <span class="text-emphasis">copy that</span>, <span class="text-emphasis">cut that</span> and <span class="text-emphasis">paste that</span>.
					These commands can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/edit/edit.talon#L117">core/edit/edit.talon</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you are comfortable with these controls, you can start getting fancy with combining step one and two. For example, <span class="text-emphasis">copy word left</span> will select the word to the left, and then copy it straight away.
