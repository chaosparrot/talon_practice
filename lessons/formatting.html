				<h1>Formatting your text</h1>
				<p>As you program, you often need to place dashes and underscores, and many other characters, between words to make a variable or a function name. Currently, you can do this perfectly well using the special characters of lesson one and dictation.
				But there is a faster way of achieving that result, and thats where formatters come in play. This lesson wants you to place a take-out order using these formatters.

					Formatters are a way to define how your text gets typed. For example, saying <span class="text-emphasis">all caps tomato salad</span> will result in the text TOMATO SALAD. There are many different formatters, and they can all be found by saying <span class="text-emphasis">format help</span>.
					You can close this menu again by saying <span class="text-emphasis">format help close</span>.
					<br/>
					The ones you will likely use a lot are <span class="text-emphasis">title</span>, which will capitalize the first letter of every word,
					<span class="text-emphasis">snake</span>, which will make your text show up like_this, and <span class="text-emphasis">camel</span> which will make your text use camelCase. <br/>
					But you can look at the formatters in that help menu from the first paragraph in case you ever forget one.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you ever choose the wrong formatter, there is a quick and easy way to reformat your text by saying <span class="text-emphasis">nope that was kebab</span>, this will turn your previously formatted text into the formatter, in this case your text will show up like-this. <br/>
					You can replace the word kebab with any other formatter like <span class="text-emphasis">all caps</span> that you can find in the help menu.
				</p>
