            <h1>Formatting your text</h1>
            <p>
              As you program, you often need to place dashes and underscores,
              and many other characters, between words to make a variable or a
              function name. Currently, you can do this perfectly well using the
              special characters of lesson one and dictation. But there is a
              faster way of achieving that result, and thats where formatters
              come in play. This lesson wants you to place a take-out order
              using these formatters.

            <p>
              Formatters are a way to define how your text gets typed. For
              example, saying
              <span class="text-emphasis">all caps tomato salad</span> will
              result in the text TOMATO SALAD. There are many different
              formatters, and they can all be found by saying
              <span class="text-emphasis">format help</span>. You can close this
              menu again by saying
              <span class="text-emphasis">format help close</span>.
              <br />
              The ones you will likely use a lot are
              <span class="text-emphasis">title</span>, which will capitalize
              the first letter of every word,
              <span class="text-emphasis">snake</span>, which will make your
              text show up like_this, and
              <span class="text-emphasis">camel</span> which will make your text
              use camelCase. <br />
              But you can look at the formatters in that help menu from the
              first paragraph in case you ever forget one.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ever choose the wrong formatter, there is a quick and easy
              way to reformat your text by saying
              <span class="text-emphasis">nope that was kebab</span>, this will
              turn your previously formatted text into the formatter, in this
              case your text will show up like-this. <br />
              You can replace the word kebab with any other formatter like
              <span class="text-emphasis">all caps</span> that you can find in
              the help menu.
            </p>
