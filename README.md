# Talon practice

This repository is meant as a small set of exercises to make learning the talon commands more fun and approachable.

## TODOs

- Add explanation texts to each lesson where to find the commands in the help menus
- Add diffing of the output to show which characters were wrong, and which were right
- Add a daily exercise showcase
